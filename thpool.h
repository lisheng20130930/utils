/**
 * @brief Add work to the job queue
 *

 * If you want to add to work a function with more than one arguments then
 * a way to implement this is by passing a pointer to a structure.
 *
 * NOTICE: You have to cast both the function and argument to not get warnings.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *    void print_num(int num){
 *       printf("%d\n", num);
 *    }
 *
 *    int main() {

 * @param  threadpool    threadpool to which the work will be added
 * @param  function_p    pointer to function to add as work
 * @param  arg_p         pointer to an argument
 * @return 0 on successs, -1 otherwise.

/**
 * @brief Wait for all queued jobs to finish
 *
 * Will wait for all jobs - both queued and currently running to finish.
 * Once the queue is empty and all work has completed, the calling thread
 * (probably the main program) will continue.
 *
 * Smart polling is used in wait. The polling is initially 0 - meaning that
 * there is virtually no polling at all. If after 1 seconds the threads
 * haven't finished, the polling interval starts growing exponentially
 * untill it reaches max_secs seconds. Then it jumps down to a maximum polling
 * interval assuming that heavy processing is being used in the threadpool.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *    ..
 *    threadpool thpool = thpool_init(4);
 *    ..
 *    // Add a bunch of work
 *    ..
 *    thpool_wait(thpool);
 *    puts("All added work has finished");

 * @param threadpool     the threadpool to wait for
 * @return nothing

 * @brief Show currently working threads

 *    threadpool thpool1 = thpool_init(2);
 *    threadpool thpool2 = thpool_init(2);
 *    ..
 *    printf("Working threads: %d\n", thpool_num_threads_working(thpool1));
 *    ..
 *    return 0;
 * }
 *
 * @param threadpool     the threadpool of interest
 * @return integer       number of threads working
